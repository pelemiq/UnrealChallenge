# UnrealChallenge
Unreal Engine programming challenges

Hi!, on this repository you will find a collection of challenges to improve your programming skills using Unreal Engine.

This is not a step by step tutorial for the problems issued, because finding you own solution is part of challenges, but of course you will receive progressive tips and key information, that you can see if you get stuck while searching for a solution.

## Challenge 1: [ Follow the path](https://github.com/pelemiq/UnrealChallenge/blob/master/Challenges/Challenge1FollowThePath.md) 


This is the very first version of the UnrealChallenge, the first challenge is based 100% on Blueprints, but it will receive a C++ version soon. Also, I have some ideas for new challenges!
